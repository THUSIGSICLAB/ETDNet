# [IEEE TIM] ETDNet for Surface Defect Detection

## :loudspeaker: Introduction
This is the official implementation of our paper titled "ETDNet: Efficient Transformer-Based Detection Network for Surface Defect Detection". This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement (IEEE TIM). 

For more details, please refer to our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10227321). This repo is based on PyTorch.

## :open_file_folder: Datasets and Weight
We release NEU-DET dataset used in this paper, including VOC style and COCO style. Note that five-flod cross-validation is used to divide the dataset.

## ðŸš€ Training
More configuration please see tools/mytrain.py and exps/neu_det/etdnet_neu_flod1.py, where you can set device num, dataset path, batch size, weight path, and so on.
```
python3 tools/mytrain.py -f exps/neu_det/etdnet_neu_flod1.py -d 4 -b 16 -c weigth/etdnet.pth --fp16
```

## :trophy: Result
Our ETDNet achieves excellent performance on the NEU-DET dataset and is more lightweight and efficient.
